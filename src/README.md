# C++ classes

* **PrimeSieve** is a high level class that coordinates prime sieving.
  It is used for printing and counting primes and for computing the nth
  prime. PrimeSieve's main method is ```PrimeSieve::sieve(start, stop)```
  which sieves the primes inside the interval [start, stop]. This class
  is mainly used by the primesieve command-line app.

* **ParallelSieve** launches multiple threads using ```std::async```
  and each thread sieves a part of the interval [start, stop] using a
  PrimeSieve object. At the end all partial results are combined to get
  the final result. This class is mainly used by the primesieve
  command-line app.

* **Erat** is an implementation of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes
  using a bit array with 30 numbers per byte, each byte of the sieve array
  holds the 8 offsets ```k = { 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31 }```.
  Its main methods are ```addSievingPrime(prime)``` which is called
  consecutively for all primes ≤ sqrt(n) and ```sieveSegment()``` which
  sieves the next segment. Erat uses the EratSmall, EratMedium and
  EratBig classes to cross-off multiples.

* **EratSmall** is a segmented sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm with a
  hard-coded modulo 30 wheel that skips multiples of 2, 3 and 5. This
  algorithm is optimized for small sieving primes that have many multiples
  in each segment. EratSmall is a further optimized implementation of
  Achim Flammenkamp's algorithm
  [[1]](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/tree/master/src#references).

* **EratMedium** is a segmented sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm with a
  hard-coded modulo 30 wheel that skips multiples of 2, 3 and 5.
  EratMedium is similar to EratSmall except that in EratMedium each sieving
  prime is sorted (by its ```wheelIndex```) after the sieving step. When we
  then iterate over the sorted sieving primes in the next segment the
  initial indirect branch ```switch (wheelIndex)``` is predicted correctly
  by the CPU which gives a speedup of about 20% for medium sieving
  primes that have a few multiples per segment.

* **EratBig** is a segmented sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm with Tomás
  Oliveira's improvement for big sieving primes
  [[2]](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/tree/master/src#references)
  and a modulo 210 wheel that skips multiples of 2, 3, 5 and 7. The
  wheel is implemented using the precomputed ```wheel210``` lookup table.
  EratBig is optimized for big sieving primes that have very few
  multiples per segment.

* **MemoryPool** is used to reduce the number of memory allocations in
  ```EratMedium``` and ```EratBig```. Up to 1024 sieving primes are
  stored in a bucket. Whenever the ```EratMedium``` and ```EratBig```
  algorithms run out of buckets for storing sieving primes they request
  a new bucket from the MemoryPool. The MemoryPool has a stock of
  buckets and only when there are no more buckets in the stock the
  MemoryPool will allocate new buckets.

* **PreSieve** is used to pre-sieve multiples of small primes ≤ 163 to speed
  up the sieve of Eratosthenes. The ```PreSieveTables.hpp``` header contains
  16 static lookup tables which have been sieved using the primes ≤ 163. The
  total size of all pre-sieve lookup tables is about 123 kilobytes. Whilst
  sieving, we perform a bitwise AND of the pre-sieve lookup tables and store
  the result in the sieve array. Pre-sieving provides a speedup of up to 30%
  when sieving the primes < 10^10.

* **SievingPrimes** is used to generate the sieving primes ≤ sqrt(stop).
  SievingPrimes is used by the CountPrintPrimes and PrimeGenerator classes.

* **CountPrintPrimes** is used for counting primes and for printing
  primes to stdout. After a segment has been sieved (using Erat)
  CountPrintPrimes is used to reconstruct primes and prime k-tuplets
  from 1 bits of the sieve array. This class is mainly used by the
  primesieve command-line app.

* **PrimeGenerator** is derived from Erat. ```primesieve::iterator``` uses
  PrimeGenerator under the hood: PrimeGenerator generates a few primes
  and stores them in a vector, next ```primesieve::iterator``` iterates over
  the vector and returns the primes. When there are no more primes left
  in the vector PrimeGenerator generates new primes.

* **primesieve::iterator** allows to easily iterate over primes. It
  provides ```next_prime()``` and ```prev_prime()``` methods.
  ```primesieve::iterator``` is also used for storing primes in a vector
  or an array.
  
* **CpuInfo** is used to get the CPU's L1 and L2 cache sizes. The
  best prime sieving performance is achieved using a sieve array
  size that matches the CPU's L1 or L2 cache size (depending on the
  CPU type).

* **Wheel** factorization is used to skip multiples of small primes ≤ 7
  to speed up the sieve of Eratosthenes. The Wheel class is used to
  initialize sieving primes i.e. ```Wheel::addSievingPrime()```
  calculates the first multiple ≥ start of each sieving prime and the
  position within the sieve array of that multiple.
  The EratSmall, EratMedium and EratBig classes are derived from Wheel.
