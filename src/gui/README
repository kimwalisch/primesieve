1. About
========

  This directory contains the primesieve GUI application developed
  with the Qt framework (http://qt-project.org).
  The INSTALL file in the current directory explains how to build the
  primesieve GUI application.

2. Project file
===============

  * primesieve.pro
    Project file for use with the Qt-Creator IDE.

3. Source files
===============

  * src/PrimeSieveGUI.cpp & .h
    Contains the graphical user interface code.

  * src/PrimeSieveGUI_menu.cpp
    Contains code related to the menu bar.

  * src/PrimeSieveProcess.cpp & .h
    Class that is used for prime sieving. PrimeSieveProcess launches
    a ParallelSieve instance in a new process, this approach
    allows to easily cancel sieving by killing the process. The
    inter-process communication between the GUI process
    (PrimeSieveGUI) and the ParallelSieve instance is realised
    via shared memory.

  * src/main.cpp
    Contains the ParallelSieve code launched by PrimeSieveProcess
    objects.
