4. Renamed doxygen directory to doc.
5. doc/Doxyfile.in: Fix out of source builds.

C++ API changes
---------------

All parallel callback functions have been removed. This was just crazy

void parallel_callback_primes(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop, void (*callback)(uint64_t prime));
void parallel_callback_primes(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop, primesieve::Callback<uint64_t>* callback);
void parallel_callback_primes(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop, void (*callback)(uint64_t prime, int thread_id));
void parallel_callback_primes(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop, primesieve::Callback<uint64_t, int>* callback);

C API changes
-------------

All parallel callback functions have been removed:

void primesieve_parallel_callback_primes(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop, void (*callback)(uint64_t prime, int thread_id));


Changes in version 5.5.0, 06/11/2015

C++ API changes
---------------

primesieve::test() has been renamed to primesieve::primesieve_test()
in order to prevent naming collisions.

primesieve::iterator::previous_prime() now returns 0 if input <= 2,
previously an error was thrown. Rationale of this change:
https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/issues/11#issuecomment-148939336

C API changes
-------------

primesieve_previous_prime() now returns 0 if input <= 2, previously
PRIMESIEVE_ERROR was returned. Rationale of this change:
https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/issues/11#issuecomment-148939336

Changes in version 5.4.2, 04/04/2015
====================================

This is a minor new release, the API and ABI are backwards compatible.

1. Use silent building on Unix-like operating systems.
2. Add screenshot to README.md.
3. Makefile.am: Add autogen.sh to EXTRA_DIST.

Changes in version 5.4.1, 09/11/2014
====================================

This is a minor new release, the API and ABI are backwards compatible.

1. Fixed a bug in the configure.ac script which used SIEVESIZE=0
   instead of SIEVESIZE=32 on QEMU virtual machines.
2. Introduce patch version (3rd version number) in order not to
   increase the minor version for bug fix only releases.

Changes in version 5.4, 14/09/2014
==================================

This is a minor new release which fixes two bugs in the computation of
prime k-tuplets (twin primes, prime triplets, ...).

1. The primesieve::print_*() functions for prime k-tuplets have been
   fixed, they were broken since primesieve-5.1.
   https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/commit/ff2fb6f7acfb7c83827803dbb09a73f4a47ab222

2. Prime 7-tuplets have been removed from primesieve (see API changes
   further down). Below are the two modulo 30 patterns for prime
   7-tuplets:

   1) 30*k + { 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}
   2) 30*k + {29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49}

   Up until now primesieve only found prime 7-tuplets of the first
   pattern e.g. it missed 5610 + {29, 31, ...}. Unfortunately this bug
   cannot be fixed because of implementation constraints. Thus I have
   decided to completely remove prime 7-tuplets from primesieve.

   C++ API changes
   ---------------

   All functions related to prime 7-tuplets have been removed:

   uint64_t primesieve::print_septuplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t primesieve::count_septuplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t primesieve::parallel_count_septuplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);

   C API changes
   -------------

   All functions related to prime 7-tuplets have been removed:

   uint64_t primesieve_print_septuplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t primesieve_count_septuplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t primesieve_parallel_count_septuplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);

Changes in version 5.3, 06/07/2014
==================================

This is a minor new release with an important bug fix and improved
documentation, the API and ABI are backwards compatible.

1. Fix use of uninitialized variable bug in primesieve::iterator:
   https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve/commit/006d572ea8fa4958eaf46c1db24c983b1ce27e1b
2. README.md update: Explain how to build from master-branch.
3. New file HACKING.md: Explains source tree, useful for developers.

Changes in version 5.2, 13/04/2014
==================================

1. Added backwards nth prime search, if n < 0 
   primesieve::nth_prime(int64_t n, uint64_t start);
   will find the nth prime < start.
2. Faster nth prime implementation, more accurate guessing of the nth
   prime gives up to 20% speed up if n < 10^8.
3. Added continuous integration testing with Travis (travis-ci.org),
   files: .travis.yml, Readme.md (shows build status).

API changes!!!

   In order to be compatible with other mathematical software like
   Mathematica, Maple and SymPy the functions below have been modified
   to return a prime > start (or < start), previously these functions
   returned a prime >= start (or <= start).

   uint64_t primesieve::nth_prime(int64_t n, uint64_t start);
   uint64_t primesieve::iterator::next_prime();
   uint64_t primesieve::iterator::previous_prime();

Changes in version 5.1, 14/02/2014
==================================

primesieve-5.1 is a minor new release with mostly bug fixes. There is
also one API change in the C bindings documented further down.

1. <primesieve.hpp> and <primesieve.h> are now compatible with
   <windows.h>, fixed CALLBACK and max() issues.
2. Fixed bug in primesieve::iterator::previous_prime().
3. Fixed bug in primesieve_previous_prime().
4. Added stop_hint optimization to primesieve::iterator which gives a
   significant speed up if only few primes are generated.
5. Replaced GENERATE_PRIMES() macro by templatized callbackPrimes()
   method (src/primesieve/PrimeFinder.cpp).

C bindings API change:

void primesieve_skipto(primesieve_iterator* pi, uint64_t start, uint64_t stop_hint);

The signature of the primesieve_skipto() function has changed, a new
'stop_hint' parameter has been added. Please refer to
http://primesieve.org/api/primesieve__iterator_8h.html for more
information.

Changes in version 5.0, 11/01/2014
==================================

primesieve-5.0 is a major new release that makes using the primesieve
library much more convenient. primesieve now includes C bindings for
all of its functions so that it can easily be used in languages other
than C++. I moved primesieve's build system to GNU Autotools and
Libtool which is more reliable than the hand written Makefile I used
previously.

primesieve-5.0 features a new API completely written from scratch that
is easier to use and that will not break binary compatibility with
every new release. The new API is not backwards compatible but porting
your code to the new API should be done quickly. You can explore
primesieve's new API online at: http://primesieve.org/api.

I bought a domain for primesieve and moved primesieve's repository
from Google Code (SVN) to GitHub (git):

http://primesieve.org
http://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve

Other changes:

1. New primesieve::iterator class that provides next_prime() and
   previous_prime() methods.
2. ParallelPrimeSieve now uses multi-threading by default, it does not
   care about arithmetic order anymore. Please do not use
   ParallelPrimeSieve directly anymore instead use the new API.
3. Renamed src/soe to src/primesieve.
4. Renamed PrimeSieveCallback<T> class to Callback<T>.
5. Moved most header files to include/primesieve.

Changes in version 4.4, 19/09/2013
==================================

This is a minor release whose sole purpose is to fix a bug in the
Makefile which is required for integrating primesieve into
Sage (http://www.sagemath.org).

1. Fixed the following bug:
   $ make shared && make install PREFIX=/user-path
2. PrimeSieve does not throw an exception anymore if (start > stop)
   instead it simply ignores the invalid input.
3. `make SHARED=yes` has been deprecated, use `make shared` instead.

Changes in version 4.3, 05/07/2013
==================================

This release improves primesieve as a library and adds an algorithm
to find the nth prime. The API of primesieve 4.3 is backwards
compatible but the ABI is not (you must recompile your application if
you want to link against a shared libprimesieve 4.3).

1. Support for storing primes in C++ vectors:
   PrimeSieve::generatePrimes   (start, stop, std::vector<T>*);
   PrimeSieve::generate_N_Primes(start, n,    std::vector<T>*);
2. New algorithm to find the nth prime:
   PrimeSieve::nthPrime(n);
   PrimeSieve::nthPrime(start, n);
3. The Makefiles now build primesieve and a static libprimesieve by
   default. A shared libprimesieve can be built using:
   $ make shared
4. Added a <primesieve/soe/stop_primesieve.h> header for
   this commonly used exception to abort sieving.
5. Updated the documentation files: INSTALL, doc/API, doc/EXAMPLES
   doc/LIBPRIMESIEVE, doc/FAQ
6. Updated the source code examples in ./examples.
7. Added the scripts/install_primesieve.sh shell script that
   automatically downloads, builds and installs the latest primesieve
   and libprimesieve version.

Changes in version 4.2, 10/03/2013
==================================

1. libprimesieve generates (callback) primes up to 5% faster on
   little-endian CPUs (x86, x86-64) due to improved
   endiansafe_cast.h (src/soe).
2. The best pre-sieve setting is now automatically chosen at
   runtime, this speeds up sieving small intervals.
3. The Makefile now supports the Solaris OS.
4. Updated documentation: README, INSTALL, doc/EXAMPLES, doc/FAQ
   and doc/LIBPRIMESIEVE. New files: AUTHORS and THANKS.
5. Fixed a bug in the primesieve GUI code (doc/BUGS).
6. Updated ExpressionParser.h (src/apps/*) to version 2.5.
7. Added more example programs: examples/store_primes_in_vector.cpp
   and examples/nth_prime.cpp.
8. Lots of refactoring to make the code easier to understand.

   API changes
   -----------

   The undocumented pre-sieve methods have been removed
   (pre-sieving is now automatically configured at runtime).

   void PrimeSieve::getPreSieve();
   void PrimeSieve::setPreSieve(int);

Changes in version 4.1, 12/01/2013
==================================

1. New PrimeSieveCallback interface class that simplifies prime
   number generation with classes, see doc/EXAMPLES.
2. The primesieve console (terminal) application now supports
   GNU-style long options e.g. --size=256.
3. Fixed a bug (for sizeof(int) > 4) in the bit population count
   algorithm, read BUGS file.
4. Updated files: README, INSTALL, doc/EXAMPLES.
5. The Makefile now uses the system's default C++ compiler instead
   of GNU g++ which makes it more portable.
6. The primesieve_error class has been moved into its own file
   src/soe/primesieve_error.h (previously PrimeSieve.h).

   API changes
   -----------

   The following two overly complex PrimeSieve methods have been
   removed:

   void PrimeSieve::generatePrimes(uint32_t start, uint32_t stop, void (*)(uint32_t, void*), void*);
   void PrimeSieve::generatePrimes(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop, void (*)(uint64_t, void*), void*);

   They are replaced by the following two new methods that greatly
   simplify prime number generation with classes, please refer
   to doc/EXAMPLES for more information.

   void PrimeSieve::generatePrimes(uint32_t start, uint32_t stop, PrimeSieveCallback<uint32_t>*);
   void PrimeSieve::generatePrimes(uint32_t start, uint32_t stop, PrimeSieveCallback<uint64_t>*);

Changes in version 4.0, 18/10/2012
==================================

primesieve 4.0 is a major new release. A lot of work has been put into
documentation and improving primesieve as a library. The API of
primesieve 4.0 is backward incompatible with primesieve 3.*, the few
changes are documented further down.

 1. Added support for OpenMP 2.*, useful for compilers that do
    not support OpenMP >= 3.0, e.g. MSVC, Apple g++.
 2. New examples directory with 12 simple example programs.
 3. New doc/API file that lists the public member functions of the
    PrimeSieve and ParallelPrimeSieve C++ classes.
 4. The Makefile is now POSIX compatible, it works with any POSIX
    shell e.g. sh, bash, ash, ksh, zsh, ...
 5. The Makefile now supports MinGW (with MSYS) and Cygwin.
 6. Fixed a shared libprimesieve bug (read doc/BUGS).
 7. Up to 10 percent faster prime number generation due to new
    internal 64-bit getNextPrime() (previously 32-bit).
 8. New unsynchronized ParallelPrimeSieve::generatePrimes() method
    that calls back primes in parallel (read EXAMPLES).
 9. Faster thread synchronization in ParallelPrimeSieve, replaced slow
    OpenMP critical directive with faster omp_test_lock().
10. Optimized prime k-tuplet (twin primes, ...) counting for
    out-of-order CPUs (src/soe/PrimeNumberFinder.cpp).
11. New primesieve_error() exception used for all exceptions within
    PrimeSieve and ParallelPrimeSieve (read EXAMPLES).
12. New pre-sieve code (src/soe/PreSieve.cpp).
13. Ported the primesieve GUI application from Qt 4 to Qt 5.

    API changes
    -----------

    The PrimeSieve 3.* count methods:

    uint64_t getPrimeCount(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
    uint64_t getTwinCount (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
    ...

    Have been renamed to:

    uint64_t countPrimes     (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
    uint64_t countTwins      (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
    uint64_t countTriplets   (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
    uint64_t countQuadruplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
    uint64_t countQuintuplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
    uint64_t countSextuplets (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
    uint64_t countSeptuplets (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);

Changes in version 3.8, 13/07/2012
==================================

 1. Improved OOP design of WheelFactorization.h.
 2. Minor speed up for big sieving primes ~2% (src/soe/EratBig.cpp),
    reduced the number of operations in the main sieving loop.
 3. Minor speed up for small sieving primes ~3% (src/soe/EraSmall.cpp),
    new inner sieving loop without instruction dependencies that uses
    only 12 asm instructions (previously 16).
 4. Improved OpenMP load balance in src/soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp.
 5. Improved code readability of EratSmall.cpp, EratMedium.cpp,
    EratBig.cpp, SieveOfEratosthenes.cpp and others.
 6. The Makefile now automatically detects the CPU's L1 data cache
    size on Unix-like OSes (Linux, Mac OS X).
 7. Renamed ./docs to ./doc
 8. Revised README.txt, added 7. Motivation.
 9. Updated INSTALL, LIBPRIMESIEVE and EXAMPLES.
10. Added version #defines to PrimeSieve.h, e.g. for this release:

    #define PRIMESIEVE_VERSION       "3.8"
    #define PRIMESIEVE_MAJOR_VERSION  3
    #define PRIMESIEVE_MINOR_VERSION  8
    #define PRIMESIEVE_YEAR           2012

Changes in version 3.7, 31/05/2012
==================================

 1. More aggressive inlining (*-inline.h), up to 10 percent faster
    prime number generation, up to 20 percent faster initialization.
 2. Reduced header file dependencies, libprimesieve now only depends on
    PrimeSieve.h or ParallelPrimeSieve.h (and PrimeSieve.h).
 3. Updated Makefiles.
 4. New template imath.h functions: isqrt(), ilog2(), isPowerOf2(), ...
    isqrt() has been rewritten using Newton's algorithm in order to
    avoid rounding errors of (int)sqrt((double)n) if n > 10^15.
 5. New internal SieveOfEratosthenes::getNextPrime(...) member function.
 6. Replaced old C-style comments with C++ comments.
 7. Updated ExpressionParser to version 2.2.
 8. uin32_t has been replaced by uint_t in src/soe/*.
 9. New int API for PrimeSieve and ParallelPrimeSieve objects, getters
    and setters now use int instead of uint32_t.
10. Updated documentation files: README, INSTALL, LIBPRIMESIEVE,
    EXAMPLES, VALGRIND, TODO, BUGS.

Changes in version 3.6, 22/04/2012
==================================

1. Improved code readability and updated source code documentation
   (src/soe directory).
2. Removed unused source code. The deprecated API of
   PrimeSieve <= 3.4 is not supported anymore, use
   PrimeSieve::getStart() instead of PrimeSieve::getStartNumber() ...
   The file EXAMPLES contains the up-to-date API.
3. src/soe/EratSmall.cpp has been enhanced to better take advantage of
   Instruction-Level Parallelism.

Changes in version 3.5, 07/02/2012
==================================

1. Bug fix for big-endian CPUs (PowerPC, SPARC), see docs/BUGS.
2. The GNU Makefile now provides an option to build primesieve as
   a shared library e.g. `make lib SHARED=yes`.
3. I have rewritten the main documentation files docs/LIBPRIMESIEVE
   and docs/EXAMPLES.
4. I have added convenience functions to the PrimeSieve class:

   void printPrimes     (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   void printTwins      (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   void printTriplets   (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   void printQuadruplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   void printQuintuplets(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   void printSextuplets (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   void printSeptuplets (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);

   uint64_t getPrimeCount     (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t getTwinCount      (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t getTripletCount   (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t getQuadrupletCount(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t getQuintupletCount(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t getSextupletCount (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   uint64_t getSeptupletCount (uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);

   void sieve(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop);
   void sieve(uint64_t start, uint64_t stop, uint32_t flags);
   void sieve();

5. src/soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp has been rewritten using OpenMP 3.0
   (previously OpenMP 2.0). The new OpenMP code is more elegant and
   scales better when lots of threads (> 32) are used.
   Compiler notes:
   OpenMP is now disabled by default for the Microsoft Visual C++
   compiler as it currently only supports OpenMP 2.0. Some compilers
   e.g. g++ 4.2 even build primesieve with OpenMP <= 2.5 but the
   resulting binary miscalculates when sieving > 2^63.
6. Helper classes and functions within src/soe are now defined in the
   the newly introduced soe namespace. This makes PrimeSieve more
   usable as a library.
7. The header file src/soe/defs.h has been renamed to config.h and its
   code readability has been improved.
8. The code of src/console/test.cpp has been simplified.

Changes in version 3.4, 05/01/2012
==================================

1. I implemented a new algorithm for medium sieving primes that is up
   to 20 percent faster on todays out-of-order CPUs,
   see src/soe/EratMedium.cpp.
2. I adapted the constants in defs.h due to the new EratMedium
   algorithm, the maximum sieveSize is now 4096 kilobytes (previously
   2048 kilobytes).
3. I revised the Makefiles and INSTALL file.
4. Added docs/LIBPRIMESIEVE and updated README and
   docs/EXAMPLES.

Changes in version 3.3, 19/12/2011
==================================

1. Minor optimizations in src/soe/EratBig.cpp (2% speed up).
2. Improved code readability and documentation of
   src/soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp.
3. The sieveSize must be <= 2048 kilobytes now (previously 8192), this
   makes the WheelFactorization.h & EratBase.h code easier to
   understand.

Changes in version 3.2, 13/11/2011
==================================

1. Fixed a bug in src/soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp, see ../docs/BUGS.
2. Added 32-bit prime number generation methods to PrimeSieve.
3. Added a PrimeSieve::cancel_sieving exception that allows to cancel
   sieving at run time (see docs/EXAMPLES).
4. ParallelPrimeSieve is now able to generate prime numbers using
   multiple threads (previously only multi-threaded counting).
5. The code readability and documentation of WheelFactorization.h/.cpp
   has been improved (e.g. renamed sieveIndex to multipleIndex).
6. PreSieve now initializes its preSieved_ array using a 2nd wheel
   (modulo 6), up to 40 percent faster.
7. I introduced a 'loopLimit' variable in EratSmall that saves some
   calculations and reduces the code size.
8. Added a testFlags(uint32_t) convenience function to PrimeSieve.
9. EratMedium has been simplified, it runs faster than v. 3.1 using
   Intel C++ 12.0 but slightly slower with most other compilers.

Changes in version 3.1, 24/10/2011
==================================

1. EratBig::sieve(uint8_t*) now processes multiple sieving primes per
   iteration, I measured a speed up of about 6 percent near 1E18.
2. STL containers are now used instead of dynamic memory allocation in
   Erat(Small|Medium) which improves multi-threading performance ~ 3%.
3. The Bucket data structure (WheelFactorization.h) has been modified
   and it performs well now with more compilers.
4. EratMedium has been simplifed, the new code is far easier to
   understand and it is faster with the GNU g++ compiler.
5. Fixed an integer overflow bug in EratMedium.cpp (see BUGS file).
6. The -test option (primesieve console) has been reviewed.
7. I improved the code readability and code documentation, the README
   and INSTALL files have also been revised.

Changes in version 3.0, 09/07/2011
==================================

1. The source code is now licensed under the New BSD License
   (previously GPL).
2. The source code is now standard C++03 and ISO C99 (stdint.h), i.e.
   I removed all compiler intrinsics and built-in functions:
   80386 BSF, cpuid, SSE4.2 POPCNT.
3. The thread scheduling of ParallelPrimeSieve has been improved,
   10 percent speed up.
4. Prime numbers are now generated using bitScanForward() instead of
   lookup tables, 10 percent speed up.
5. Implemented a fast bit population count function, see
   popcount_lauradoux() in bithacks.h.
6. Revised the option handling in the console version of primesieve,
   added two new options: -o<OFFSET> and -r<PRE-SIEVE>
7. README has been rewritten from scratch.
8. Improved the code readability and revised the comments of the sieve
   of Eratosthenes implementation.
9. ResetSieve has been renamed to PreSieve.

Changes in version 2.2, 26/05/2011
==================================

1. Added the file docs/EXAMPLES which shows how to use
   PrimeSieve and ParallelPrimeSieve objects.
2. Fixed 4 minor bugs (see BUGS).
3. 10% initialization speedup due to enhancement in
   ModuloWheel::setWheelPrime(uint64_t, uint32_t*, uint32_t*, uint32_t*)
4. Added prime number generation functions and a convenience function
   to count prime numbers to PrimeSieve.
5. The thread interface of ParallelPrimeSieve has been simplified.
6. The code now compiles and runs with the sunCC compiler.
7. The code readability has been improved.
8. The documentation has been updated.

Changes in version 2.1, 11/04/2011
==================================

1. Fixed a start number bug (read doc/BUGS).
2. Now supports integer arithmetic expressions as number input.
3. Uses OpenMP instead of processes.
4. Added qt-gui/README file.
5. Fixed a bug in the Makefile (clang++ compiler).
6. Updated the README file.

Changes in version 2.0, 15/02/2011
==================================

1. Added soe/ParallelPrimeSieve.cpp which counts primes in parallel
   using OpenMP.
2. Added an arithmetic expression parser (./expr) to ease number input.
3. Added a test suite to the console version of primesieve
   (option: -test) which runs various correctness tests.
4. The console version has been reviewed and is first released.
5. Fixed a minor bug in soe/PrimeNumberFinder.cpp which counts and
   prints the prime preceding the start number (see BUGS file).
6. Improved the memory pool of soe/EratBig.cpp, primesieve 1.0 ran
   into trouble when sieving near 2^64.
7. Makefile modified to better support GCC compatible compilers,
   e.g. make CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
